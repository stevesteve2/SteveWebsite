\
Currently, he is an an [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2404649&HistoricalAwards=false) and [AXA](https://axa-research.org/fund-your-research/post-doctoral-fellowships) postdoctoral fellow at New York University.

\
Steve studies the psychology of technology. He is interested in how important psychological phenomena—such as polarization, intergroup conflict, the spread of (mis)information, and mental health—interact with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and social media. 

Some of his prior work has focused on [how social media incentivizes the creation of polarizing content](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2024292118), [why we believe and spread misinformation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01540-w), [why people share content that they say they do not like](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231190392), and the [impact of unfollowing hyperpartisan influencers](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/acbwg). He has also explored the relationship between [social media usage and vaccine hesitancy](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/1/4/pgac207/6726650) or the [psychological effects of attending live theatre](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002210312100038X). His current work focuses on how the [impact of social media differs around the globe](https://globalsocialmediastudy.com/), and how we can use recent advances in [artificial intelligence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2308950121) to improve methods in psychological science.  

He was named an APS "[Rising Star](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/members/awards-and-honors/aps-rising-stars/news-rising-stars)" in 2024 and was included on the 2025 [Forbes 30 Under 30](https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2025/social-media?profile=steve-rathje) list.
