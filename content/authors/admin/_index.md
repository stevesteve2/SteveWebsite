Steve studies intergroup conflict, the spread of (mis)information, and how these topics interact with digital technologies, such as social media and artificial intelligence. 

Some of his work has focused on [how social media incentivizes the creation of polarizing content](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2024292118), [why we believe in and spread misinformation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01540-w) or [why people share content that they say they do not like](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231190392).
