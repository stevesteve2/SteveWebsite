"Have I Shared Fake News" is an app that will give you feedback on how much fake and hyper-partisan news you have shared as well as the political bias of the news you have shared on Twitter. It also gives you feedback on the kind of language you use on Twitter. Use it to better understand your Twitter behavior, and to (optionally) contribute data for research on social media use:
