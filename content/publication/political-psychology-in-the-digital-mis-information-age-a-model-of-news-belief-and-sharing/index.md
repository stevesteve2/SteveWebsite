abstract: The spread of misinformation, including “fake news,” propaganda, and
  conspiracy theories, represents a serious threat to society, as it has the
  potential to alter beliefs, behavior, and policy. Research is beginning to
  disentangle how and why misinformation is spread and identify processes that
  contribute to this social problem. We propose an integrative model to
  understand the social, political, and cognitive psychology risk factors that
  underlie the spread of misinformation and highlight strategies that might be
  effective in mitigating this problem. However, the spread of misinformation is
  a rapidly growing and evolving problem; thus scholars need to identify and
  test novel solutions, and work with policy makers to evaluate and deploy these
  solutions. Hence, we provide a roadmap for future research to identify where
  scholars should invest their energy in order to have the greatest overall
  impact.
