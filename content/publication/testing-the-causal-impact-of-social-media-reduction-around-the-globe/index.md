abstract: "More than half of the world’s population uses social media. There is
  widespread debate among the public, politicians, and academics about social
  media’s impact on important outcomes, such as intergroup conflict and
  well-being. However, most prior research on the impact of social media relies
  on samples from the United States and Western Europe, despite emerging
  evidence suggesting that the impact of social media is likely to differ across
  the globe. Building on the results of pilot experiments from three countries
  (n = 894), we plan to conduct a global field experiment to measure the causal
  impact of reducing social media usage for two weeks across 23 countries
  (projected n > 8,000). We will then test how social media reduction influences
  four main outcomes: news knowledge, exposure to online hostility, intergroup
  attitudes, and well-being. We will also explore how the effects of social
  media reduction vary across world regions, focusing on three
  theoretically-informed country-level moderators: income level, inequality, and
  democratic strength. This large-scale, high-powered field experiment, and the
  global dataset resulting from it, will offer rare causal evidence to inform
  ongoing debates about the impact of social media and how it varies around the
  world. "
