abstract: Understanding how vaccine hesitancy relates to online behavior is
  crucial for addressing current and future disease outbreaks. We combined
  survey data measuring attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine with Twitter data
  in two studies (N1 = 464 Twitter users, N2 = 1,600 Twitter users) with
  preregistered hypotheses to examine how real-world social media behavior is
  associated with vaccine hesitancy in the United States (US) and the United
  Kingdom (UK). In Study 1, we found that following the accounts of US
  Republican politicians or hyper-partisan/low-quality news sites were
  associated with lower confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine—even when controlling
  for key demographics such as self-reported political ideology and education.
  US right-wing influencers (e.g. Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson) had followers
  with the lowest confidence in the vaccine. Network analysis revealed that
  participants who were low and high in vaccine confidence separated into two
  distinct communities (or “echo chambers”), and centrality in the more
  right-wing community was associated with vaccine hesitancy in the US, but not
  in the UK. In Study 2, we found that one's likelihood of not getting the
  vaccine was associated with retweeting and favoriting low-quality news
  websites on Twitter. Altogether, we show that vaccine hesitancy is associated
  with following, sharing, and interacting with low-quality information online,
  as well as centrality within a conservative-leaning online community in the
  US. These results illustrate the potential challenges of encouraging vaccine
  uptake in a polarized social media environment.
