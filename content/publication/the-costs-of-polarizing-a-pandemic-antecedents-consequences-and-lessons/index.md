abstract: One of the signature features of the American response to the COVID-19
  pandemic has been the degree to which perceptions of risk and willingness to
  follow public health recommendations have been politically polarized. This
  paper will succinctly review research showing that every phase of the pandemic
  and key policies were polarized, including judgments of risk, spatial
  distancing, mask wearing, and vaccination. We will describe the role of
  political ideology, partisan identity, leadership, misinformation, and mass
  communication in this public health crisis. We will then assess the overall
  impact of polarization on the progression of the pandemic, offer a analysis of
  key policy questions, and identify a set of research questions for scholars
  and policy experts. Finally, we will include policy recommendations for
  avoiding the same mistakes in future public health crises.
