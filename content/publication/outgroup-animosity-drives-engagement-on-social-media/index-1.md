abstract: "There has been growing concern about the role social media plays in
  political polarization. We investigated whether outgroup animosity was
  particularly successful at generating engagement on two of the largest social
  media platforms: Facebook and Twitter. Analyzing posts from news media
  accounts and US congressional members (n = 2,730,215), we found that posts
  about the political outgroup were shared or retweeted about twice as often as
  posts about the ingroup. Each individual term referring to the political
  outgroup increased the odds of a social media post being shared by 67%.
  Outgroup language consistently emerged as the strongest predictor of shares
  and retweets: the average effect size of outgroup language was about 4.8 times
  as strong as that of negative affect language, and about 6.7 times as strong
  as that of moral-emotional language – both established predictors of social
  media engagement. Language about the outgroup was a very strong predictor of
  “angry” reactions (the most popular reactions across all datasets), and
  language about the ingroup was a strong predictor of “love” reactions,
  reflecting ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. This outgroup effect
  was not moderated by political orientation or social media platform, but
  stronger effects were found among political leaders than among news media
  accounts. In sum, outgroup language is the strongest predictor of social media
  engagement across all relevant predictors measured, suggesting that social
  media may be creating perverse incentives for content expressing outgroup
  animosity."
