abstract: The spread of misinformation has become a global issue with
  potentially dire consequences. There has been debate over whether
  misinformation corrections (or" fact-checks") sometimes" backfire," causing
  people to become more entrenched in misinformation. While recent studies
  suggest that an overall" backfire effect" is uncommon, we found that
  fact-checks were more likely to backfire when they came from a political
  outgroup member across three experiments (N= 1,217). We found that corrections
  reduced belief in misinformation; however, the effect of partisan congruence
  on belief was 5x more powerful than the effect of corrections. Moreover,
  corrections from political outgroup members were 52% more likely to
  backfireâ€“leaving people with more entrenched beliefs in misinformation. In
  sum, corrections are effective on average, but have small effects compared to
  partisan identity congruence, and sometimes backfire--especially if they come
  from a political outgroup member. This suggests that partisan identity may
  drive irrational belief updating.
