abstract: "There is considerable debate over whether and how social media
  contributes to polarization. In a correlational study (n1 = 1,447) and two
  digital field experiments (n2 = 494, n3 = 1,133), we examined whether
  (un)following hyperpartisan social media influencers contributes to
  polarization and misinformation sharing. We found that incentivizing Twitter/X
  users to unfollow hyperpartisan social media influencers improved feelings
  toward the out-party by 23.5% compared to the control group, with effects
  persisting for at least six months. Unfollowing also led participants to
  engage with more accurate news and increased satisfaction with their Twitter/X
  feeds—without reducing engagement. This study demonstrates the long-term
  causal impact of exposure to hyperpartisan influencers. Moreover, unlike other
  social media reduction interventions, unfollowing is a targeted approach: like
  a scalpel, it surgically removes a few harmful parts of one’s feed, allowing
  the beneficial aspects to remain."
