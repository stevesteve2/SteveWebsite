abstract: The social and behavioral sciences have been increasingly using
  automated text analysis to measure psychological constructs in text. We
  explore whether GPT, the large-language model underlying the artificial
  intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, can be used as a tool for automated
  psychological text analysis in several languages. Across 15 datasets (n =
  47,925 manually annotated tweets and news headlines), we tested whether
  different versions of GPT (3.5 Turbo, 4, and 4 Turbo) can accurately detect
  psychological constructs (sentiment, discrete emotions, offensiveness, and
  moral foundations) across 12 languages. We found that GPT (r = 0.59-0.77)
  performs much better than English-language dictionary analysis (r = 0.20-0.30)
  at detecting psychological constructs as judged by manual annotators. GPT
  performs nearly as well as, and sometimes better than, several top-performing
  fine-tuned machine learning models. Moreover, GPT’s performance has improved
  across successive versions of the model, particularly for lesser-spoken
  languages. Overall, GPT may be superior to many existing methods of automated
  text analysis, since it achieves relatively high accuracy across many
  languages, requires no training data, and is easy to use with simple prompts
  (e.g., “is this text negative?”) and little coding experience. We provide
  sample code and a video tutorial for analyzing text with the GPT application
  programming interface. We argue that GPT and other large-language models may
  democratize automated text analysis by making advanced natural language
  processing capabilities more accessible, and may help facilitate more
  cross-linguistic research with understudied languages.
