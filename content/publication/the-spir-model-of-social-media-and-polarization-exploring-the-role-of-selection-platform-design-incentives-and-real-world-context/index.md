abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media, nearly 4 billion people now
  have online accounts where they engage with their social network, learn about
  the news, and share content with other people. The rapid growth of this
  technology has raised important questions about its potential impact on
  political action and polarization. We propose the SPIR Model to address how
  Selection, Platform Design, Incentives, and Real World Context might explain
  social mediaâ€™s role in exacerbating polarization and intergroup conflict.
  Rather than simply asking whether social media as a whole causes polarization,
  we examine how each of these processes can spur polarization in certain
  contexts. We discuss how interventions might target each of these factors to
  mitigate polarization.
