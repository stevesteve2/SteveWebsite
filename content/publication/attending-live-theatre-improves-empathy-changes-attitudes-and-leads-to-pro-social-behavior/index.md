abstract: Can attending live theatre improve empathy by immersing audience
  members in the stories of others? We tested this question across three field
  studies (n = 1622), including a pre-registered replication. We randomly
  assigned audience members to complete surveys either before or after seeing
  plays, and measured the effects of the plays on empathy, attitudes, and
  pro-social behavior. After, as compared to before, seeing the plays, people
  reported greater empathy for groups depicted in the shows, held opinions that
  were more consistent with socio-political issues highlighted in the shows, and
  donated more money to charities related to the shows. Seeing theatre also led
  participants to donate more to charities unrelated to the shows, suggesting
  that theatreâ€™s effects on pro-sociality generalize to different contexts.
  Altogether, these findings suggest that theatre is more than mere
  entertainment; it can lead to tangible increases in empathy and pro-social
  behavior.
