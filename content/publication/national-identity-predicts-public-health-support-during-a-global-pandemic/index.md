abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating global health crisis.
  Without a vaccine or effective medication, the best hope for mitigating virus
  transmission is collective behavior change and support for public health
  interventions (e.g., physical distancing, physical hygiene, and endorsement of
  health policies). In a large-scale international collaboration (N = 46,450
  across 67 countries), we investigated why people adopted public health
  behaviors and endorsed public policy interventions (e.g., closing bars and
  restaurants) during the early stages of the pandemic (April-May, 2020).
  Results revealed that respondents who identified more strongly with their
  nation consistently reported engagement in public health behaviors and greater
  support for public health policies. We also found a small effect of political
  orientation, indicating that left-wing respondents were more likely to report
  public health behaviors and support for public health measures than right-wing
  respondents. We discuss the implications of links between national identity,
  leadership, and public health for managing the COVID-19 pandemic and future
  pandemics.
