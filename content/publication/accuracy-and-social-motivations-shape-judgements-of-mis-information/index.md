abstract: The extent to which belief in (mis)information reflects (lack of)
  knowledge versus a (lack of) motivation to be accurate is unclear. Across four
  experiments (n = 3,364), we motivated US participants to be accurate by
  providing financial incentives for correct responses about the veracity of
  true and false political news headlines. Financial incentives improved
  accuracy and reduced partisan bias in judgements of headlines by about 30%,
  primarily by increasing the perceived accuracy of true news from the opposing
  party (d = 0.47). Incentivizing people to identify news that would be liked by
  their political allies, however, decreased accuracy. Replicating prior work,
  conservatives were less accurate at discerning true from false headlines than
  liberals, yet incentives closed the gap in accuracy between conservatives and
  liberals by 52%. A non-financial accuracy motivation intervention was also
  effective, suggesting that motivation-based interventions are scalable.
  Altogether, these results suggest that a substantial portion of peopleâ€™s
  judgements of the accuracy of news reflects motivational factors.
