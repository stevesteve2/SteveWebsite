abstract: Why do some ideas spread widely, while others fail to catch on? We
  review the psychology of information spread, or the psychology of “virality.”
  Similar types of information tend to spread in many contexts, both online and
  offline. This is likely because similar psychological processes drive
  information spread across contexts. We explain how these psychological
  processes interact with structural features of information environments,
  including norms, networks, and incentive structures. Surprisingly, widely
  shared content is often not widely liked—a phenomenon called “the paradox of
  virality.” We discuss the strengths and limitations of the virality metaphor.
  We also discuss future directions for the field, such as leveraging recent
  advances in artificial intelligence to better understand how information
  spreads across cultures and contexts.
