abstract: While conspiracy theories may offer benefits to those who believe in
  them, they can also foster intergroup conflict, threaten democracy, and
  undercut public health. We argue that the motivations behind conspiracy theory
  belief are often related to social identity. Conspiracy theories are
  well-positioned to fulfill social identity needs such as belongingness goals,
  the need to think highly of one's in-group, and the need to feel secure in
  one's group status. Understanding the social motives that attract people to
  conspiracy theories should be a focus of future research, and may be key to
  creating more successful interventions to reduce socially harmful conspiracy
  theories.
