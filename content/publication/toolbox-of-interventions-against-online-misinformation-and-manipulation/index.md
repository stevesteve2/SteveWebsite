abstract: "The spread of misinformation through media and social networks
  threatens many aspects of society, including public health and the state of
  democracies. A wide range of individual-focused interventions aimed at
  reducing harm from online misinformation have been developed in the behavioral
  and cognitive sciences. We, an international group of 26 experts, introduce
  and analyze our toolbox of interventions against misinformation, which
  includes an up-to-date account of the interventions featured in 42 scientific
  papers. A resource for scientists, policy makers, and the public, the toolbox
  delivers both a conceptual overview of the breadth of interventions, including
  their target and scope, and a summary of the empirical evidence supporting the
  interventions, including the methods and experimental paradigms used to test
  them. The toolbox covers 10 types of interventions: accuracy prompts,
  debunking, friction, inoculation, lateral reading, media-literacy tips,
  rebuttals of science denialism, self-reflection tools, social norms, and
  warning and fact-checking labels."
