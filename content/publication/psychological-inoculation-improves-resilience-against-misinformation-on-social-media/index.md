abstract: "Online misinformation continues to have adverse consequences for
  society. Inoculation theory has been put forward as a way to reduce
  susceptibility to misinformation by informing people about how they might be
  misinformed, but its scalability has been elusive both at a theoretical level
  and a practical level. We developed five short videos that inoculate people
  against manipulation techniques commonly used in misinformation: emotionally
  manipulative language, incoherence, false dichotomies, scapegoating, and ad
  hominem attacks. In seven preregistered studies, i.e., six randomized
  controlled studies (n = 6464) and an ecologically valid field study on YouTube
  (n = 22,632), we find that these videos improve manipulation technique
  recognition, boost confidence in spotting these techniques, increase peopleâ€™s
  ability to discern trustworthy from untrustworthy content, and improve the
  quality of their sharing decisions. These effects are robust across the
  political spectrum and a wide variety of covariates. We show that
  psychological inoculation campaigns on social media are effective at improving
  misinformation resilience at scale."
