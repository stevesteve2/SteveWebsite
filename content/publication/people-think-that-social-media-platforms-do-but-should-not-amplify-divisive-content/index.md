abstract: Recent studies have documented the type of content that is most likely
  to spread widely, or go “viral” on social media, yet little is known about
  people’s perceptions of what goes viral or what should go viral. This is
  critical to understand because there is widespread debate about how to improve
  or regulate social media algorithms. We recruited a sample of participants
  that is nationally representative of the US population (according to age,
  gender, and race/ethnicity) and surveyed them about their perceptions of
  social media virality (n = 511). In line with prior research, people believe
  that divisive content, moral outrage, negative content, high-arousal content,
  and misinformation are all likely to go viral online. However, they reported
  that this type of content should not go viral on social media. Instead, people
  reported that many forms of positive content – such as accurate content,
  nuanced content, and educational content – are not likely to go viral, even
  though they think this content should go viral. Importantly, these perceptions
  were shared among most participants, and were only weakly related to political
  orientation, social media usage, and demographic variables. In sum, there is
  broad consensus around the type of content people think social media platforms
  should and should not amplify, which can help inform solutions for improving
  social media.
