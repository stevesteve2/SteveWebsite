abstract: "In recent years, interest in the psychology of fake news has rapidly
  increased. We outline the various interventions within psychological science
  aimed at countering the spread of fake news and misinformation online,
  focusing primarily on corrective (debunking) and pre-emptive (prebunking)
  approaches. We also offer a research agenda of open questions within the field
  of psychological science that relate to how and why fake news spreads and how
  best to counter it: the longevity of intervention effectiveness; the role of
  sources and source credibility; whether the sharing of fake news is best
  explained by the motivated cognition or the inattention accounts; and the
  complexities of developing psychometrically validated instruments to measure
  how interventions affect susceptibility to fake news at the individual level."
