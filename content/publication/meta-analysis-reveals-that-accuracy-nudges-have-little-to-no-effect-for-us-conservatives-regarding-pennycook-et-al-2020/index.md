abstract: According to recent work, subtly nudging people to think about
  accuracy can reduce the sharing of COVID-19 misinformation online (Pennycook
  et al., 2020). The authors argue that inattention to accuracy is a key factor
  behind the sharing of misinformation. They further argue that “partisanship is
  not, apparently, the key factor distracting people from considering accuracy
  on social media” (p. 777). However, our meta-analysis of data from this paper
  and other similar papers finds that partisanship is indeed a key factor
  underlying accuracy judgments on social media. Specifically, our meta-analysis
  suggests that the effectiveness of the accuracy nudge intervention depends on
  partisanship such that it has little to no effect for US conservatives or
  Republicans. This changes one of Pennycook and colleague’s (2020) central
  conclusions by revealing that partisanship matters considerably for the
  success of this intervention. Further, since US conservatives and Republicans
  are far more likely to share misinformation than US liberals and Democrats
  (Guess et al., 2019; Lawson & Kakkar, 2021; Osmundson, 2021), this
  intervention may be ineffective for those most likely to spread fake news.
