abstract: System-level change is crucial for solving society’s most pressing
  problems. However, individual-level interventions may be useful for creating
  behavioral change before system- level change is in place and for increasing
  necessary public support for system-level solutions. Participating in
  individual-level solutions may increase support for system-level
  solutions–especially if the individual-level solutions are internalized as
  part of one’s social identity.
