abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all domains of human life,
  including the economic and social fabric of societies. One of the central
  strategies for managing public health throughout the pandemic has been through
  persuasive messaging and collective behaviour change. To help scholars better
  understand the social and moral psychology behind public health behaviour, we
  present a dataset comprising of 51,404 individuals from 69 countries. This
  dataset was collected for the International Collaboration on Social & Moral
  Psychology of COVID-19 project (ICSMP COVID-19). This social science survey
  invited participants around the world to complete a series of moral and
  psychological measures and public health attitudes about COVID-19 during an
  early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (between April and June 2020). The survey
  included seven broad categories of questions: COVID-19 beliefs and compliance
  behaviours; identity and social attitudes; ideology; health and well-being;
  moral beliefs and motivation; personality traits; and demographic variables.
  We report both raw and cleaned data, along with all survey materials, data
  visualisations, and psychometric evaluations of key variables."
